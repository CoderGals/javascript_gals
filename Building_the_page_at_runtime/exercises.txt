1. What are the two phases in the lifecycle of a client-side web application?

  1. HTML processing - building the DOM and JavaScript code execution
  2. Event handling

2. What is the main advantage of using the addEventListener method to register
   an event handler versus assigning a handler to a specific element property?

2. If we want to register more than one event handler to a specific DOM element,
   we use the addEventListener method to register those event handlers.

   Meanwhile, assigning a handler to a specific element property is that - we always
   would run that specific event handler on that element.


3. How many events can be processd at once?
3. Only one event can be processed at once.

4. In what order are events from the event queue processed?
4. Events in the event queue are processed in the order in which they occurred.
